The issue was likely caused by missing or conflicting units within the `calc()` expression.  While `vw` is a unit, it's crucial to ensure consistency.  The corrected code ensures that the subtraction involves units that align correctly:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100vw - 20px);
}
```

This version explicitly subtracts 20 pixels from 100vw, ensuring the calculation is performed correctly.
