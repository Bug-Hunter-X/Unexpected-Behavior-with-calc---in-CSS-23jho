# Unexpected Behavior with calc() in CSS

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS to calculate the width of an element based on the viewport width. The expected behavior is for the element to be 20 pixels less than the viewport width. However, the actual result is different.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The solution, providing the expected behavior, is in `bugSolution.css`.
