The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected.  I'm trying to calculate the width of an element based on the viewport width, but the result is incorrect. Here's my code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100vw - 20px);
}
```

I expect the element to be 20 pixels less than the viewport width, but it's not.
